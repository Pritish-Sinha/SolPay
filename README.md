## SolPay
## Inspiration
Reading about Blockchain gave us the idea to build a service that allowed any kind of website to easily and securely integrate this method of payment, while also making the process as smooth as possible for the end customer

## What it does
The idea behind SolPay is to bring the power of Solana Blockchain and wallets to as many people as possible. To make this happen required two solutions. A smooth experience for the end customer, as well as seamless integration for any websites wanting to serve those customers. The service can be embedded into any website with minimal code. It allows that website to create and track Solana Virtual Accounts. It also provides the end user with a clean, easy to use interface to manage their Wallet and Virtual Accounts. All sensitive data including login information never has to be entered into the end website, so users can trust that they are safe and secure.
